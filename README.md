# **How I started in Data Science**

### *Premed*

I was a premed student, and I was a very *ambitious* premed student. I strived to get all the highest grades possible, volunteered in Chemistry helpdesk, was actively preparing for MCAT exam. 2 years passed, I got my Associate Degree, my GPA at the moment was 3.89. I was told during one of the career coaching sessions that the university I was attending wasn't big enough for a reputable medical school, and therefore I was better off to transfer to a bigger university. 

I had to drive across all the country, but eventually, I got into one of the top 30 US universities. The story is quite lengthy, I will point out major events in order to save you the reading time.
- The teaching was terrible. I cannot speak for all of the faculty, but a good portion of my professors merely didn't care if their students will pass the exam or not. The complexity level gap between a classwork, a homework, and an exam was gigantic. Getting an A in some classes without sacrificing the other grades was a "mission imposslble".
- On top of the aforementioned, I tried to get into MCAT prep class. I got rejected because my essay wasn't good enough, or it wasn't motivational enough. Isn't determination to spend 10+ years of your life studying and pay hefty amounts for tuition realizing you won't make a penny any time soon, working 50-60 hrs a week after motivational enough? To me, that's a pure dedication to a medical field. 
- Even after that rejection, I didn't give up and told myself that I am going to find materials to study for MCAT and medical professional to shadow myself. I was stubborn, but then one thought crossed my mind: what if medical schools starts rejecting me for some silly reason? Medical schools are very picky, and some people spend 4-5 years just to get in one. What would I be doing in a meantime? I had no idea (like a lot of Undergraduate students), so I asked my biology teacher where could I work with my degree. The answer she gave me was very shakey and vague: it was very clear she doesn't know and doesn't care much. My concerns were not groundless. 
- That was the moment I lost my motivation completely. If there is no reward at the end, or the reward isn't guaranteed - what's the point of investing that much time and money? I dropped out of the unversity, and with hindsight, I have never regretted that decision. 

### *Data Science*

Because of the described above situation, I had to find a new career path. After some time researching, I came to a conclusion I have never considered coding as a career. 

I decided to get my feet wet and found one the 2hr long Python tutorials on YouTube. The tutorial wasn't ment to be for complete beginners, therefore I could not completely grasp some ideas from the video at the time, however, I quickly learned that coding isn't that scary and I can enjoy doing that.  

Coding = type of engineering. You might think: what do you even engineer? Mechanical engineers work with materials, electrical engineers work with circuits, chemical engineers create new substances... Can you engineer by pressing buttons? 

I would call it a "Logical Engineering". Just like any type of engineering utilizes combination of things, their properties, and heuristics, coding shares the same principles when you create parts and assemble them into one piece to achieve something that did not exist before. There are inefficient code as well as optimized code, like any engineering has bad and good examples.

I really loved coding, however, I understood that just being proficient in one programming language isn't enough. Coding is a general name for a dosen of subdivisions, and I had to pick what kind of coding I should choose as a my career. 

Thinking about my opportunities, I wanted something futuristic, challenging, and on demand. That's how I found out about AI and machine learning ideas. 
I couldn't wrap my mind around how people use machines to find songs by a short fragment, or how apps recommend videos that are indeed very interesting. That seemed a pure magic to me, so I decided to dedicate myself to Data Science. 

### *Coding Bootcamp*

Data Science is a field that combines several areas of study into one: statistics, coding, linear algebra, and many others. Studying just about Machine Learning isn't an optimal strategy, I was understanding that. Therefore, I had to find a roadmap, a program to learn everything needed to start the career in Data Science. After some research, I chose Lambda School coding bootcamp and got accepted into the Data Science program.

The beginning was really harsh, yet the further I went the more I enjoyed it. At some point, I knew enough of basics to start researching questions by my own. There were numerous things that bootcamp did not teach us, so I did approximately half of what I know by myself. 

I successfully completed DS track at Lambda School and graduated. I enjoyed doing projects and deploying them, my favorite project was the app that would predict where the twit came from, using ML. I liked working by myself in my own pace, but at the same time, I loved working in a team of students on a big and challenging project.

# **What is so interesting about data?**

I never regretted picking Data Science out of Fullstack, Web, iOS, UI/UX, and other fields. There is a reason for it: Data Science is like a real science, it has a lot in common with engineering or medical field. I certainly used a lot of my early developed skills to become successful in Data Science. 

Data Science doesn't focus much on design or beauty of the appearance, it is very dry and to the point. What it cares about instead is data. Data is generated daily in large amounts, and even more data will be generated in the future. All data has some meaning to it. While some data is readily consumable or perceptible (for example a video or a picture), some data needs to be processed in order to reveal it's meaning. For that kind of data, it is not obvious what it says, or how we can use it to retreive valuable information about the future or the past. That's where Data Science comes into play: using relaitvely old studies (statistics, math) combined with cutting-edge modern technologies, we can retrieve certain patterns, make predicitons, and take actions in response to what the data says. In a way, it's using a math+modern computational power to predict the future or reveal hidden things about the past.

# **Data analysis is boring, right?**

Not at all. I did quite a bit of math in my life and can totally understand how math can be really boring. We all have been there. However, when something is done with the purpose, and the result will determine what will be the next step, the process becomes much more interesting. 

Data analysis is a free fall. While there are certain worflows and guidelines, a good chunk of it is your own perception of data and intuition. There is certainly a room for experimentation, trying new things, improvement. 

Additionally, if calculations and linear algebra might seem a bit boring, visualization totally aren't. This is the tastiest part of data analysis, how to present your discoveries. Even though Data Science is dry, the output doesn't have to be. Vice versa, presenting beautiful graphs, with a right color palette, labels, and diagram type is my favorite part of data analysis!

<summary><b>College Diploma Questions</b></summary>

# **For those who care about degrees**

The highest degree I have is an **Associate's Degree in General Studies**. It might sound like a big surprise for some people, but it didn't help me much (at all) to get any job I couldn't get without it. Therefore (and unsurprisingly), after carefully evaluating my risk of studying another 3 semesters, I came to a conclusion that I'd rather study myself everything I will be sure is needed for the job, find books and paid courses, earn certificates instead of studying General Requirements, wasting my time and money on something that will be totally useless for a career, listening to professors who are merely unmotivated to be helpful. 

I know everyone has a different college experience, but this is my perception of college. I did not discard the idea of getting a bachelor's degree in a long run - if there will be a guarantee of employment with a decent salary upon completion of the Undergraduate program, I'd be eager to resume my education and be within the reasonable range of GPA. However, the risk isn't worth the reward at the moment. 

Trusting a person without a degree might be a risky decision, and this is exactly why I created this portfolio. Instead of a list of completed courses with vague names and credit hours, I provide you examples of what I already can do *out of the box*. You don't need to train me in using Pandas, or Matplotlib, or SQL, like you most likely would need to with recent college graduates. I highly doubt Tableau or Power BI is taught in college as well. Finally, a portfolio shows that if I can develop such skills and acquire knowledge without an educator through self-study, I can also work independently with a minimal learning curve.

The vast majority of the IT companies still use resume screening software that will weed out those who don't have a Bachelor's Degree listed. There is also a study that proved degree holders to be more efficient and successful in their careers. However, while there is a huge variance between people with no Bachelor diploma (think of a McDonalds cashier vs self-taught interpreneur holding a store), there is much less variance between college degree holders. What it means is companies trust college alumni not for the knowledge or experience the last acquired; companies trust for the sole reason that those had enough motivation and perseverance to finish their degree. At the same time, blindly discarding applicants without diploma is also discarding potentialy good workers, perhaps even better than college graduates, and many large companies like Google, Costco, and Apple stopped asking about diplomas as they see it irrelevant.  

Finally, I was always tempted to say this: if your Hiring/Department manager still vehemently believes in diplomas, suggest them to take a trip to a local university, pick a class of interest, and sit trough one class. Let them ask students what homework do they do, and what was on the last exam. Most likely, students will tell you that in-class material doesn't align well with exams, which is common. Additionally, the university program lags behind the industry development and cannot be changed instantly (someone needs to write books, design exams and homeworks, approve it all together), therefore knowledge will be basic and insufficient for a real-world industry.

<summary><b>My Projects</b></summary>

# **My projects**

The most challenging (and also exciting!) projects I've done so far is the Enigma Machine. You can find it in my Cryptography repository. 
To intrigue you and save you the reading time, I won't say much about what is Enigma Machine and how I came to replicating one, but instead I will mention some obstacles I had to overcome. 
Apparently, the first obstacle was emulating some mechanical device algorithmically, for which I had to describe a class with all the methods that a real Engima Machine would utilize. I started it over once, because the original way of designing it showed some serious flaws, I was lucky to salvage parts of code from the first unsuccessful try. 
However, that was a minor problem compared to the next one. A military Engima Machine was supposed to have a plugboard (commutator), which is a set of paired plugs meant to be connected one to another by a piece of wire. How do you even emulate this on a computer? There was no such a widget for pairing two elements. 
I solved this problem in a very peculiar way: wrote a function that creates buttons dynamically upon calling. Each button stores the value of connected pair. When user presses on a button, that equals to unpluging the wire, and button disappears.

>While this phrase looks strange, this is a little verificaiton phrase that tells me you read until the very end. I decided to put it into "Projects" tab since this is the most significant tab to read, in my opinion. If I ask you whether you've seen my portfolio during the interview, tell me this phrase, and I will know that you read my full story and truly interested in my candidacy.
